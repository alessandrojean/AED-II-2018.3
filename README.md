## Build instructions

Use the following commands to compile any `.c` file in this repository.

```bash
# Assuming you have the GNU C Compiler in
# your PATH, but can be MinGW or the Visual
# Studio compiler too if you are under an 
# Windows environment.

# Compiles the file in the bin folder.
$ gcc file.c -o bin/file
# If the compiler complain about the folder,
# create it using the command below, and
# run the command above again.
$ mkdir bin
# Run the program.
$ ./bin/file
```

If you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), 
you can setup your envinroment using 
[tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks) 
and the Microsoft official 
[C/C++ extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp), 
that allows you to debug and lint your code.
